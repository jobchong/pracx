# 290. Word Pattern

**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Hashmap

## Problem

Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `s`. Specifically:

	- Each letter in `pattern` maps to exactly one unique word in `s`.

	- Each unique word in `s` maps to exactly one letter in `pattern`.

	- No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.

## Constraints

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 300`
- `pattern` contains only lower-case English letters.
- `1 <= s.length <= 3000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters and spaces `' '`.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.
